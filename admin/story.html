            <h3>Glimpse into the past..</h3>
                In my life, there has always been a passion for creating, expressing and consistent learning. All of my hobbies have
                been framed around these three things. As a child, I found myself enamered by music with all it's intricacies to constructing legos to create whatever popped into my head. Once I began college, I found myself on the same path only I went into a different media form of film photography. The ambiguity and constant learning of new techniques made for a frustrating, yet a thriving learning environment for myself. During my teenage years, I found myself mesmerized and interested in computers and the way they
                process.

            <h3>More recent years..</h3>
                In recent years, living paycheck to paycheck working retail and taking care of other peoples lives, I decided it was time to take care of myself. I revisited coding and found that I do enjoy it. The next steps led me to how will I make this happen, where can I do this, and how long would it take me to complete it. After substantial googling and a friends recommendation, I found NSS- Nashville Software School. Every thing lined up in my life, personally and financially, to make this happened. So I jumped at the opportunity to improve my life and have a career I could be proud of.
